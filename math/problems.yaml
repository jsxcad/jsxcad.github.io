  solution: >-
    Let x be the number of people who share and y be the number of people who
    keep things for themselves.

    $$2x+y=25

    ewline 3x-y=25$$ 

    Solving this system of equations gives us x = 5 and y = 20.

    Therefore, 5 people like to share and 20 people prefer to keep things for
    themselves.

  problem: A socialist bakery wants to share their delicious baguettes equally
    among the villagers. The bakery is 300 centimeters long and the villagers
    are 50 centimeters apart. How many villagers can the bakery share baguettes
    with if they want each villager to have at least 10 centimeters of baguette
    space?
  length: 283
  tags:

    - null
  solution: First, we need to calculate the total length of baguette space
    available. 300 meters (bakery length) / 60 meters (villager spacing) = 5
    villagers. Next, we need to ensure each villager gets at least 1 meter of
    baguette space. 1 meter / 60 meters = 1/6 of a baguette per villager. So,
    the bakery can share baguettes with 5 villagers while ensuring each gets at
    least 1/6 of a baguette.

  solution: "First, we need to find the time it takes for the train to travel 1
    km. We can do this by dividing the speed by 1000: 80 km/h ÷ 1000 = 0.08
    h/km. Then, we need to multiply the time per km by the distance to the
    station: 0.08 h/km × 300 km = 24 h. Therefore, it will take the train 24
    hours to reach the front of the station."

  solution: "Let x be the current speed of the train in km/h. Then 80% of x is x -
    20%. The distance travelled in the past 10 hours is 360 / x km. The distance
    travelled 10 hours ago is 360 / (x - 0.2x) km. The difference between these
    two distances is 360 km. So we have the equation: 360 / x - 360 / (0.8x) =

  solution: First, we need to calculate the distance the train traveled in the

    calculate the distance the train traveled in the first two hours. The train
    traveled 80 km in the last hour, and it traveled for 2 hours before that.
    So, the distance traveled in the first two hours is 80 * 2 = 160
    km.  Finally, the distance the train traveled when it reached the point that

    Let x be the number of juniors and y be the number of seniors.
     x + y = 30
     y - x = 7
     Solving the second equation for y: y = x + 7
     Substituting y in the first equation: x + (x + 7) = 30
     2x + 7 = 30
     2x = 23
     x = 11.5
     So there are 11.5 juniors and 11.5 + 7 = 18.5 seniors in the debate team.

  problem: A group of friends are debating which is the faster way to get to
    school. One friend claims they can arrive in 30 minutes if they bike at 10
    meters per second. Another friend argues they can get there in 20 minutes if
    they run at 8 meters per second. How much time would they save if they biked

  solution: "First, we need to calculate the distance to school. Let's call it D
    meters. Then, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.   Let's
    substitute the given speeds:  - Biking time = D / 10 m/s  - Running time = D
    / 8 m/s  The time saved by biking is the difference between the two running
    times:   Time saved = Running time - Biking time = D / 8 m/s - D / 10 m/s =
    D(1/8 - 1/10) m/s  Therefore, the time saved by biking instead of running is
    D/40 minutes."

    Let x be the number of tigers and y be the number of lions.

     Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
     (2y + 10) + y = 100
     Combine like terms:
     3y + 10 = 100
     Subtract 10 from both sides:
     3y = 90
     Divide both sides by 3:
     y = 30
     Substitute y back into the second equation:
     x = 2(30) + 10
     x = 60 + 10
     x = 70
     There are **70 tigers** and **30 lions** in the game.

    the formula: distance = speed × time, we can write:  $$720 = 1.2x \times
    (time-1)$$  Solving for time, we get:  $$time = \frac{720}{1.2x} + 1 =
    \frac{600}{x} + 1$$  Therefore, the original speed of the train is 600
    km/h."

  solution: |-
    Let x be the cost of a croissant and y be the cost of a pain au chocolat.
    10x + 5y = 20
    5x + 12y = 17.50
    Solving the first equation for x:
    10x = 20 - 5y
    x = (20 - 5y)/10
    Substituting the expression for x in the second equation:
    5((20 - 5y)/10) + 12y = 17.50
    Solving for y:
    y = 2.5
    Substituting the value for y back in the first equation:
    x = (20 - 5*2.5)/10
    x = 1.5
    Therefore, a croissant costs €1.50 and a pain au chocolat costs €2.50.

  solution: |-
    Let x be the number of $10 bills and y be the number of $5 bills.
    5y + 10x = 150
     y - x = 10
    Solving the second equation for y, we get y = x + 10.
    Substituting that into the first equation, we get 5(x + 10) + 10x = 150.
    Solving this equation, we get x = 10 and y = 20.
    Therefore, there are 10 $10 bills and 20 $5 bills in the fund.

  solution: "Let t be the time in minutes since the bonfire started. The amount of
    firewood remaining is then 4.5 - 1.5t meters. When the firewood is
    completely consumed, this amount is 0. So we can write the equation:  $$0 =
    4.5 - 1.5t$$  Solving for t, we get:  $$1.5t = 4.5$$  $$t = 3$$  Therefore,
    the firewood will be completely consumed at 7:30 PM + 3 minutes = 7:33 PM."

  solution: >-
    Let x be the weight of the smaller stash (in kilograms).

    The weight of the larger stash is then 3x.

    Together, the stashes hold 240 kilograms, so:

    x + 3x = 240

    Solving for x, we get:

    x = 60

    The smaller stash holds 60 kilograms, and the larger stash holds 3x = 3 * 60
    = 180 kilograms.

  solution: First, we can calculate the runner's speed in meters per minute by
    dividing the distance covered (300 meters) by the time taken (5 minutes).
    Speed = 300 meters / 5 minutes = 60 meters per minute.  Next, we can find
    the time it takes the runner to cover 800 meters by dividing the distance to
    be covered (800 meters) by the speed of the runner (60 meters per minute).
    Time = 800 meters / 60 meters per minute = 13 minutes.  Therefore, it will

    562.5 km/h.  Next, we need to use the formula: time = distance /
    speed.   Time taken at new speed = 450 km / 562.5 km/h = 0.8

    16.67 m/s. Next, we multiply the speed by the time to find the distance.
    16.67 m/s * 2 h = 33.34 m. Therefore, the train traveled 33.34 meters in
    total.

  solution: |-
    Let x be the cost of 1 croissant and y be the cost of 1 pastry.
    5x + 3y = 13
    3x + 4y = 10
    Solving the first equation for x: x = (13 - 3y) / 5
    Substituting this into the second equation: 3((13 - 3y) / 5) + 4y = 10
    Solving for y: y = 2
    Substituting this back into the first equation: x = (13 - 3*2) / 5 = 3.
    So, 7 croissants and 4 pastries would cost 7*3 + 4*2 = 25€.

    Let x cm be the width of the rectangle.

    The length of the rectangle is x + 5 cm.

    Perimeter = 2(width + length) = 40 cm

    2(x + x + 5) = 40

    2(2x + 5) = 40

    4x + 10 = 40

    4x = 30

    x = 7.5 cm

    Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 7.5 cm and the length is 7.5 + 5 =

  solution: The lightweight material commonly used in airplane wings is fiberglass
    reinforced polymer (FRP). This material is strong and durable, yet it is
    significantly lighter than traditional materials like steel or aluminum.
    This reduction in weight helps to improve fuel efficiency and allows
    airplanes to carry more passengers and cargo.

  problem: A rectangular garden bed has a perimeter of 24 meters. If the length is

  length: 142
  tags:
    - geometry
    - perimeter
    - rectangle
    - algebra
    - fifth-grade
  solution: First, we can let x represent the width of the garden bed. The length
    is x + 2. The perimeter is 2(length + width) = 2(x + x + 2) = 2(2x + 2) = 4x
    + 4. We know the perimeter is 24, so 4x + 4 = 24. Solving this equation
    gives us x = 5. Therefore, the width is 5 meters and the length is 5 + 2 = 7
    meters.

  solution: |-
    Let x be the number of days it takes for the seed to cover the entire field.
    2^x = 100
    2^x = 10^2
    x = 4
    It will take 4 days for the seed to cover the entire field.

    which means that any variables declared inside it are not accessible outside
    of it. Even though we're trying to access the `sensitiveData` variable
    outside of the function, it's not possible because it's defined within the

    and returns its value plus one. When we call the function with the argument
    `2`, the function is executed and the result is logged to the console. The
    key point here is that the function is not explicitly invoked when we define
    it, but rather when we call it later in the code.

    logs 'die' to the console. If not, it declares a new arrow function `y` that
    logs 'alive' when called. The key point here is that the variable `x` is
    declared outside of any function or block scope, so its value can be
    accessed and modified within the `if` statement.

    . The `demolish` function is a simple example of an arrow function in
    JavaScript. Arrow functions are used to define small, one-time-use functions
    that can be called with the arrow symbol (`=>`). In this case, the
    `demolish` function takes one argument `a` and logs it to the console using
    `console.log(a)`. The function is then called with the string `'hello'`,
    which should log `'hello'` to the console.  The concept being highlighted
    here is the use of arrow functions in JavaScript. Arrow functions are a
    shorthand way to define small functions that can be used to perform simple
    operations or transformations on data.

  solution: 30. This program demonstrates the concept of function closures. The
    `magnitude` function takes two arguments and returns their sum. When we call
    `console.log(magnitude(10, 20))`, it prints `30`. This is because the
    `magnitude` function has access to its own scope, which includes the
    variables `x` and `y` that were passed to it. Even though these variables
    are no longer in scope outside of the function, they remain available within
    the function itself. This is an important concept for understanding how
    functions work in JavaScript.

    converted to a value. In this case, we're using template literals to insert
    the value of the `name` variable into a greeting message.

    - ternary operator
    - conditional statements
    - 5th grade
    - javascript-program
  solution: Messi scored!. This code demonstrates the concept of optional chaining
    in JavaScript. The `goalkeeper` function takes a `target` parameter and
    checks if it's truthy (not null or undefined). If the target is present, it
    logs the message with the goal scored by that target. The gotcha here is
    that the function uses the ternary operator (`? :`) to conditionally log the
    message, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not understood correctly.

    - arrow-functions
    - javascript-program
  solution: 3. The program defines an arrow function `definitely` that takes a
    single argument `x`. The function simply returns the input value. Then it
    calls `console.log` with the result of calling `definitely` with the
    argument 3, which should log `3` to the console. This demonstrates the
    concept of variable scope and the use of arrow functions in JavaScript.

  solution: You are serving unexcused. In this code snippet, we're using a
    variable `detention` and concatenating it with a string to form a sentence.
    The concept being tested is the usage of template literals in JavaScript.
    Template literals allow us to embed expressions inside string literals.

  solution: "  You have reached gold level!  .   This code demonstrates the
    concept of strict equality (`===`) in JavaScript. The program defines a
    variable `premium` and sets it to `'gold'`. Then, it uses a conditional
    statement with a ternary operator to check if `premium` is equal to
    `'silver'`. If the condition is true, it logs the message `'Not Premium'`.
    Otherwise, it logs a congratulatory message indicating that you have reached
    the `'gold'` level. The program highlights the importance of strict equality

    - javascript-program
  solution: 100. This program demonstrates variable shadowing. Variable shadowing
    occurs when a variable with the same name is declared inside a block (such
    as a function or an if statement), which hides the outer scope's variable
    with the same name. In this case, we create an object `fort` and assign it
    to a variable `fort`. Then, we define an arrow function `fortHeight` that
    logs the value of `fort.height`. We call `fortHeight()` to execute the
    function. The output will be 100.

    incremented each time the function is called. This behavior might seem

    - 5th-grade
    - javascript-program
  solution: 3. This program demonstrates the concept of variable scope and
    hoisting. The `flop` function is defined as a constant arrow function, which
    means it can only be reassigned with another value of the same type. In this
    case, we're returning the input value `x`. When we call
    `console.log(flop(3))`, we expect to see the output `3` because the function
    simply returns its input. However, the gotcha is that if we try to reassign
    the `flop` variable with a new value before calling it, JavaScript will
    automatically move the assignment to the top of the scope, effectively
    'hoisting' the variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

  problem: A freshly baked croissant is put in a cooling rack at a temperature of
    200°C. If the croissant cools at a rate of 10°C per minute, how long will it
    take for the croissant to cool to a temperature of 50°C?

  solution: First, we need to calculate the temperature difference between the
    croissant's current temperature and the desired temperature. 200°C - 50°C =
    150°C. Next, we divide the temperature difference by the cooling rate to
    find the time it takes for the croissant to cool. 150°C / 10°C/min = 15
    minutes. Therefore, it will take the croissant 15 minutes to cool to a
    temperature of 50°C.

    years, his age will be x+5. Given that in 5 years he will be 15, we have the
    equation: x+5 = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, the grandson is
    currently 10 years old."

    Let x be the actual speed of the airplane in km/h.

    Given that the distance is 1200km and time is 3h:

    Distance = Speed × Time

    1200km = x × 3h

    Therefore, x = 400km/h.

    If the speed is overrated by 20%, the actual speed is 120% of 400km/h, which
    is 480km/h.

    Time taken with the overrated speed = Distance / Actual Speed = 1200km /
    480km/h = 2.5h.

    Therefore, the flight will actually take 2.5 hours.

    Let x be the time spent feeling fast (in minutes) and y be the time spent
    feeling slow (in minutes).

    3x + 2y = 10

    2y = x

    Solving these equations, we find x = 4 and y = 2.

    Therefore, the snail spent 4 minutes feeling fast and 8 minutes feeling
    slow.

    The distance covered at the usual speed is 800x km.

    At the faster speed, the distance covered is 1200 km.

    The time taken at the faster speed is x - 0.2x = 0.8x hours.

    Therefore, 1200 = 800x + 800(0.2x),

  solution: Let x be the cost of 1 scoop. Then, 2x is the cost of 2 scoops, and 3x
    is the cost of 3 scoops. 4x is the cost of 4 scoops. The special deal gives
    2 scoops for 5 euros, so 4 scoops cost 5 + (4-2)x euros. Therefore, 4x = 5 +

  solution: First, we need to calculate the amount of energy remaining in the

    original charge.  Next, we need to determine the amount of charge the phone
    loses per minute. 2% is equivalent to 0.02. So, the phone loses 0.02 * 100 =
    2% of its charge per minute.  To find out how long it takes for the phone to
    drain completely, we can divide the remaining charge by the amount of charge
    lost per minute. 75% / 2% = 37.5 minutes. Therefore, it will take the phone

    Let l and w represent the length and width of the garden bed in meters.
    2l + 2w = 40
     l = w + 2
    Substituting the second equation into the first equation:
    2(w + 2) + 2w = 40
     Solving for w: 
    2w + 4 + 2w = 40
     4w = 36
     w = 9
    Substituting w back into l = w + 2:

  problem: A photographer travels 120m at a speed of 3m/s to reach a photoshoot
    location. If the photoshoot starts in 4s, how long will it be until the
    photographer arrives at the location?

  tags:

    - time-distance-speed
  solution: First, we need to calculate the time it takes the photographer to
    travel the 120m. 120m / 3m/s = 40s. Next, we subtract the time remaining
    until the photoshoot from the time taken to travel to get the time until the
    photographer arrives. 40s - 4s = 36s. Therefore, it will take the
    photographer 36s to reach the photoshoot location.

  tags:
    - time

  solution: First, we need to know how many seconds it takes for the brook to
    travel 1 meter. 1 meter / 3 meters per second = 1/3 of a second. Next, we
    need to find out how many seconds it takes for the brook to travel 120
    meters. 120 meters / 3 meters per second = 40 seconds. So, it will take the
    brook 40 seconds to travel 120 meters.

  solution: |-
    Let x be the number of pencils in the bigger box.
    Smaller box: x - 20
    Total pencils: x + (x-20) = 50
    2x - 20 = 50
    2x = 70
    x = 35
    Bigger box has 35 pencils, smaller box has 35-20 = 15 pencils.
