    "solution": "To find the mass of the asteroid, we can use the formula: mass = density * volume. We already know the diameter, so we can find the volume by assuming a sphere and using the formula for the volume of a sphere: volume = (4/3)πr³. Then, we can substitute the values into the mass formula and solve for mass.",
