There were ''3'' times as many grams of incense in Jar A as in Jar B. How many grams of incense were there altogether?<ruled-line></ruled-line><ruled-line></ruled-line><ruled-line></ruled-line>",
    "solution": "Let ''x'' represent the original number of grams of incense in Jar B. Jar A originally had ''x + 20'' grams. After the transfer, Jar B had ''x - 50'' grams, and Jar A had ''x + 20 + 50 = x + 70'' grams. We know that Jar A now has ''3'' times as many grams as Jar B, so we can set up the equation: ''x + 70 = 3(x - 50)''. Solving for ''x'': ''x + 70 = 3x - 150''. ''220 = 2x''. ''x = 110''. Jar B originally had ''110'' grams, and Jar A originally had ''110 + 20 = 130'' grams. Therefore, there were a total of ''110 + 130 = 240'' grams of incense altogether.",
