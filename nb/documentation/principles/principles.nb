# Principles

There are a number of principles informing design choices.

1. Geometry Representation should be Context Free -- taking subgeometry out of a container should not affect how it operates.
1. Short names are preferable -- aim for 4 letter operators.
1. Code can be executed out-of-order -- dependencies are determined by variables.
1. Side-effects are special -- side effects between statements need to be via "import './module.js';" without exports.
1. The interior of items is not implicitly accessed from the exterior -- except where the effect is uniform.
1. Notebooks should be usable as normal ecmascript -- but not all ecmascript will be usable as notebooks.
